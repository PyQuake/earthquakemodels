[ERROR] Message:  Wrapper did not output anything that matched the expected output ("Result of algorithm run:..."). Please try executing the wrapper directly
[ERROR] We tried to call the target algorithm wrapper, but this call failed.
[ERROR] The problem is (most likely) somewhere in the wrapper or with the arguments to SMAC.
[ERROR] The easiest way to debug this problem is to manually execute the call we tried and see why it did not return the correct result
[ERROR] The required output of the wrapper is something like "Result for ParamILS: x,x,x,x,x".);
